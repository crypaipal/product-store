<p>This is my simple Product store app which uses Javascript, Node.js and Express for Backend part and React, Chakra UI for Frontend part and MongoDB database.</p>
<p>The application performs all CRUD operations: it allows the user to add products by specifying their name, price and photo link, as well as delete and edit them. It uses verification of correctness of data input, changing the interface theme between dark and light. 
The application is uploaded to a remote server on Render.</p>
